    "pageContent": "Libra was my first love. Aptos is the heir to the vision of Libra, but so much more. Open finance means two things. First, it means that anyone can access financial infrastructure and assets around the world at any time. Second, developers can integrate financial products without any permission required. DeFi is the start, TradFi on-chain assets are the bridge, but the future is a world where the worldâ€™s economic activities move on-chain. Aptos is the only chain with the worldâ€™s most scalable and cost-efficient web3 infrastructure to match the pace of innovation in these spaces - holding the top 4 records for daily mainnet transactions. While weâ€™ve already announced significant upcoming innovations in rAPTr, Block-STM v2, and Move 2, thereâ€™s a massive new infrastructure initiative we will announce in 2025 that will bring on a new wave of pioneering developers and projects.",
